### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft and a recent graduate of Williams College. I love ultimate frisbee :flying_disc:, traveling ✈️, and music 🎶.

Currently:
- 🗻 Thinking about my recent trip to Asia (Seoul 🇰🇷 → Yantai 🇨🇳 → Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto/Nara 🇯🇵 → Hong Kong 🇭🇰).
- :hammer: Building my [Spotify Artist Radar](https://github.com/alansun25/spotify-artist-radar).
- 🎧 Working on a hyperpop project.

Previously:
- Interned at Microsoft and did full-stack work on an M365 data analytics platform (Summer 2022).
- Helped revamp the frontend and UX for [Algora's](https://algora.io/#/) web app (Summer 2021).
- Conducted user interviews and suggested new features for [Spendlab](https://www.spendlab.org/) (Summer 2020).

I'm always looking to collaborate on fun projects! Contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alansun25/) or [email](mailto:alansun.dev@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by!
