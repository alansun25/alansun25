### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a junior at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. View my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5_r4Oi--9jdKQ9Hc37he3LK287gqMUB/view?usp=sharing).

Currently:
- On break, but will be studying abroad at [AIT-Budapest](https://www.ait-budapest.com/) for the Spring 2022 term.
- Working on some fun Python projects (coming soon!).
<!-- - Building an interactive [web app](https://alansun25.github.io/infection-networks/) with visualizations that will allow you to view how infection spreads through certain social networks (TypeScript, React, Cytoscape, Chakra UI, Firebase).
- Redesigning the Williams College Ultimate Frisbee website migrating from HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to React and Tailwind. See it live [here](https://www.williamsultimate.com/)!
- Tracking my [basketball shooting workout data](https://quark-shroud-4aa.notion.site/2e697c5fe4de4195a42b6da1998b0c04?v=967fefbc76df4f27a44c97ed13c38a1d) to eventually build a web dashboard containing visualizations and statistical analyses of my progress. -->

Previously:
