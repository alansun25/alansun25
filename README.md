### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a sophomore at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics.

Currently:
- Performing network analysis research at Williams (network simulations using R).
- Doing full stack development at [Algora PBC](https://algora.io/#/) (working with TypeScript, React, and Go).
- Building a virtual, in-browser study environment (inspired by [Virtual Cottage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1369320/Virtual_Cottage/)).
- Tracking my basketball shooting workout data to eventually build a dashboard containing visualizations and statistical analyses of my progress.
- Learning Python.

Thanks for stopping by!
