### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a sophomore at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. I love creating user-facing apps, and am hoping to find a career in software engineering. 

**What I'm Up To:** Recently, I've been doing a lot of stuff with JavaScript, and have also started learning Ruby. My current goal is to become proficient enough with these languages to create a full-stack app with React and Rails.

Thanks for stopping by!
