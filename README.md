### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a senior at Williams College studying computer science. I play ultimate frisbee :flying_disc: and (sometimes) make music :notes:.

Currently:
- :books: Taking classes in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, formal linguistics, and sound art.
- :hammer: Building my [Spotify Artist Radar](https://github.com/alansun25/spotify-artist-radar).
- :shushing_face: Working on a secret (perhaps musical) project.

Previously:
- Interned at Microsoft and did full-stack work on an M365 data analytics platform (Summer 2022).
- Helped revamp the frontend and UX for [Algora's](https://algora.io/#/) web app (Summer 2021).
- Conducted user interviews and suggested new features for [Spendlab](https://www.spendlab.org/) (Summer 2020).

I'm always looking to collaborate on fun projects! Contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alansun25/) or [email](mailto:mralansun@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by!
