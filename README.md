### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a rising junior at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics.

Currently:
- Performing [network analysis research](https://github.com/alansun25/network-analysis) at Williams (network simulations using R).
- Doing work as a software engineer intern at [Algora PBC](https://algora.io/#/) (working with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind).
- Building a web app with visualizations that will allow you to view how infection spreads through certain social networks (JavaScript, React, Tailwind).
- Tracking my basketball shooting workout data to eventually build a web dashboard containing visualizations and statistical analyses of my progress (R Shiny).
- Learning Python.

Thanks for stopping by!
