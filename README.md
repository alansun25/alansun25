### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a sophomore at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm currently performing network analysis research on campus and doing a bunch of coding with React and TypeScript. My next priority is to learn Python and/or Node.

Thanks for stopping by!
