### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a rising junior at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics.

Currently:
- Doing work as a software engineer intern at [Algora PBC](https://algora.io/#/) (working with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind).
- Rebuilding the Williams College Ultimate Frisbee website ([repo](https://github.com/WilliamsUltimate/williamsultimate)) using a completely new design and migrating from HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to React and Tailwind.
- Creating a [web app](https://github.com/alansun25/infection-networks) with visualizations that will allow you to view how infection spreads through certain social networks (TypeScript, React, Cytoscape, Chakra UI).
- Tracking my [basketball shooting workout data](https://quark-shroud-4aa.notion.site/2e697c5fe4de4195a42b6da1998b0c04?v=967fefbc76df4f27a44c97ed13c38a1d) to eventually build a web dashboard containing visualizations and statistical analyses of my progress.

I'm always looking to collaborate on fun projects! => [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alansun25/) â€¢ [email](mailto:mralansun@gmail.com)

Thanks for stopping by!
