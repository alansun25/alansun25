### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft working on Copilot analytics. I love basketball, traveling, and reading.

What I'm building:
- [Syncify](https://github.com/alansun25/spotify-artist-radar).
- Breadbox (TBD)

Books I've read recently:
- Severance by Ling Ma (currently reading)
- Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner
- Goodnight Tokyo by Atsuhiro Yoshida

I'm always looking to collaborate on fun projects! Contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alansun25/) or [email](mailto:alansun.dev@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by!
