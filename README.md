### Hi! I'm Alan.

I'm a sophomore at Williams College pursuing a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. I love web development and creating user-facing apps, and am hoping to find a career in software engineering. 

**What I'm Up To:** Recently, I've been doing a lot of stuff with JavaScript, and have also started learning Ruby. My current goal is to create a full-stack application with React and Rails (I have a pretty rough idea that will combine my interest in software dev and music). I'm also doing work with [Spendlab](https://www.spendlab.org/) as a UI/UX Development Intern, building an expandable note-taking feature for the application.

Thanks for stopping by!
